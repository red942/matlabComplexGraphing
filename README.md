# matlabComplexGraphing
Project for Math/Cs 371 computational problem solving. 
For this project, we are graphing complex-valued functions in multiple ways and packaging them together in a Matlab app.
Once this is released, feel free to use it however you wish.

To use the main app, just launch ComplexGraphing.mlapp. Then you can do the following things:
* Enter your own functions by typing in the box at the bottom after
  - Changing the resolution by typing in the box in the top right (1000 is a good number)
  - adding scale, so you aren't zoomed in on one point (10 for each is good)
* Change where in the graph you are looking by toggling the "move center" button
  - (to move the center, simply type the real and imaginary offset (positive direction) into the box)
* Use special functions such as the gamma and zeta function, by using the drop down box on the right.
